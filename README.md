# Minimum Viable React+Webpack

There are many boilerplate projects. This one is mine. The goal here is simply
fitting together the basic pieces for a Single Page Application: React, Babel and Webpack.

Where this differs from other boilerplate projects is:

* builds for production with `npm run build`
* run a HMR dev-server on port 3000 with `npm run dev`
* Has enough Babel stuff to cope with React.
* It doesn't do anything else.
